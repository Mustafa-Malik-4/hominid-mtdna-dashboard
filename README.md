"Python_dashboard" contains all files related to the python implementation of this project.
To view the dashboard, run all cells in "main.ipynb" on jupyter or some equivalent notebook workspace.
The dashboard should open in your default browser after a few moments.
If you're unable to do that, watch the video named "python_demo.mp4" to see what it could have done :(

"R_dashboard" contains all files related to the R implementation of this project.
To view the dashboard, click the file "test_dashboard.html".
It should open in your default browser.
Another method would be opeining "test_dashboard.qmd" in RStudio and rendering it.
